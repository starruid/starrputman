            When it comes to video art, I tend to really enjoy the sound element of the art. For this piece I recorded footage of me at one of my favorite locations in San Jose, and created the audio myself. I layered multiple sounds, some more musical and some more naturalistic, to create a cohesive audio that fit with the footage I had taken.

            I was inspired to create a work using the colors and reflections made when shining a light on translucent objects. In this case, plastic and glass gemstones. Then, like the previous piece, I compiled multiple sounds into a music-like audio to match with the visuals. Visual editing was also done to highlight the contrast between the colorful light and the surrounding darkness.

            One of my earlier videos, this artwork, required me to compile several stock clips into one video with a cohesive theme. In my case, the theme was Marine Animals. This piece helped me better understand the roles video and audio can play, and how they work together in video art to create compelling pieces that the audience can enjoy visually and auditorily.          <br> </p>

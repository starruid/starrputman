                This artwork required me to open up the code of an image and tamper with it until it created a glitching effect. I then took the glitched image, along with the original, into photoshop. Where I then cut and colleged them together to create a cohesive piece. <br>
<br>
In doing so I learned more about the way images are created digitally, and about all the possibilities that can be created by manipulating those photos, either through programs like Photoshop, or just by messing with the file itself.               </p>

      The prompt for this work was “memory”, which inspired me to talk about my father and a lot of memories surrounding his death. I wanted to capture the struggle when trying to recall old memories, especially of someone who is no longer alive. To create that feeling, I used some illustration elements, but most of the composition is done with Photoshop. By layering a few elements like the drawing and photos with filters and overlays, I was able to create those bright colors and textures that give the art its striking visual. <br>
<br>
I included two versions, one in color to allow the vibrancy of the color to stand out. The other in black and white to allow the values and the texture to be highlighted.

I really enjoy using my graphic design skills to create posters. There are so many different ways you can use type and images as graphic elements to create a cohesive image that communicates something directly to its audience. Especially with the vast amount of different purposes people have for making posters, the design can differ greatly whether you are making some kind of advertisement, infographic, or something purely decorative. <br>

                  As someone who has had a fascination with pirates for years, it was always a goal of mine to design my own “jolly roger” to use as a personal logo. To create such an image, I had to go through multiple iterations. The images below show some examples of the different versions I had created. Even though the details may appear small, each one was considered when making something that would be visually pleasing and recognizable for branding. While iterative design can be tedious, it trains us to recognize the different elements of art and how to use them within our own work.

      As part of the iterative design, an alternate design was considered before returning to the design above. While still visually pleasing, the asymmetrical elements of the final design create more interest and movement in the logo.    </p></div>

        Starr Putman is an artist born and raised in the Bay Area. They have experience with both traditional and digital forms of art, but digital drawing has always been their passion. Often taking inspiration from fantasy and sci-fi media, Starr’s art centers around these fictional genres. They love to create new worlds and characters using their art, especially alongside other forms of storytelling. They are currently most familiar with drawing and graphic design, but would love to branch out to digital forms of art.      </p>

        I always considered myself an artist, I have sketchbooks dating back to elementary school and doodles in the margins of nearly every assignment I have turned in. Most if it isn’t very good, but the passion has been there from the beginning. 
        <br>
        It stems from a need to create. Every book, show, or song I become fixated on inspires me in some way. I can spend hours in my head dreaming up stories and interesting characters, and art has always been my way of communicating those dreams to others. I don’t think I have ever considered going into any other career than art, much to my parents dismay. It’s always drawn me in, interested me in a way nothing else has. However as I’ve gotten older I’ve found more direction in my own art, and in my passions. I love creating, and that's something I want to pursue in my career. Specifically in the form of video games. I’m still a little conflicted on exactly how I want to work on creating games, but I would like to create art for them either way.
        <br>
        Character and environmental design is a major interest of mine, and it’s something I’ve done many times for personal projects. Though I’ve focused mostly on characters in previous art, I plan on expanding my skills to help me better create the stories I envision. I have a lot of ideas I would like to work on, and stories I would love to tell with others. 
        <br>
        I still have a lot to learn when it comes to digital media art. There are so many different ways to create art digitally, many of which I haven’t even tried. As I am interested in video games, I plan on pursuing those skills which will assist me in that area. I have enjoyed the little amount of creative coding that I have done so far, and I would love to try different things such as 3-D modeling. Overall, I look forward to continuing this journey and exploring all these artforms that will help me in my quest for creation.
